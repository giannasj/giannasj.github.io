                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My mission is to learn and grow through life's struggles to become a passionate and 
                focused person. I excel when I am independently exploring and researching academic 
                topics. Still, I aim to find others who share this trait so that we can support and motivate 
                each other. As people come and go in my life, I hope to inspire them to discover what 
                makes them happy and encourage them to actively pursue a richer, more fulfilling life.</p>
